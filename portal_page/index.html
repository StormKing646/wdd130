          <h1>This is me</h1>
          <p>Hey, I'm Spencer Butler, and I've always been captivated by the world of technology. Seriously, anything with wires, screens, or code immediately grabs my attention—if it runs on tech, I'm driven to understand its inner workings. When I'm not immersed in a new project or diving into a gaming session with friends, you'll likely find me out on the lake, wakesurfing and constantly pushing myself to nail new tricks.<br><br>Beyond the digital and aquatic realms, I've got a soft spot for K-pop, and my audiobook collection is always growing. But perhaps most importantly, I cherish spending quality time with my friends and family, often with a cat or two curled up nearby. I'm a firm believer in lifelong learning and constantly seek out new knowledge and experiences, always striving to live life to the fullest.</p>

          <h1>My family</h1>
          <p>My family's roots are firmly planted in the beautiful state of North Carolina, a place that holds a special significance for us. Our household is a vibrant and bustling one, with a grand total of eleven children, each bringing their unique personality and perspective to the mix. Adding to our lively crew are our beloved animal companions: three cats who reign supreme over their cozy corners, a loyal dog always ready for an adventure, and a cheerful flock of chickens clucking happily in the yard.<br><br>Despite our individual differences, which are as numerous as the stars, we share a deep love for the simple pleasures of life and the joy of togetherness. Our favorite escapes often involve the sun-drenched shores of the beach, where we can bask in the warmth and play in the waves. The serene waters of the lake also call to us, offering endless opportunities for shared fun. We spend countless hours boating, the wind in our hair, the thrill of jet skiing and tubing bringing laughter to our lips, and the peaceful glide of paddleboarding offering moments of tranquility. As the day draws to a close, we often gather to witness the breathtaking spectacle of the sunset, painting the sky with fiery hues and creating cherished memories that bind us together.</p>

          <h1>Client Report</h1>
          <p>For my project, I decided to make a video game review website. I found pictures that matched the games I reviewed and wrote about some of the best single-player and multiplayer games.<br><br>I emailed my wireframe to my lead developer, and our communication went well. There weren't any issues.<br><br>The homepage content I asked for was added, but some parts weren't placed exactly how I pictured them in my wireframe. As of now, I haven't seen any updates on the child pages.<br><br>If I were to hire someone again, I'd want to make sure they have a good reputation by talking to people who have worked with them before.</p>
          <h1>Lead Developer Report</h1>
          <p>As a lead developer, I set up a Teams group chat for my team. I shared the wireframe that I was given and assigned each junior developer a child page to work on. I followed up each week to see how they were doing and asked if they needed anything from me.<br><br>Talmage did a great job creating the "Services" page. Mitchell hasn't made any progress on his "About" page so far.<br><br>I talk with Zachary in class, through email and Teams messages. I asked if he wanted to change anything on the homepage, and he said he liked how it looked.<br><br>I added the junior developers to Zachary's GitHub repo and sent him the link to his website.<br><br>This was my first time using GitHub. It was a bit confusing at first, but I got a lot of help from my teacher and classmates. I learned how to use it pretty quickly.</p>
          <h1>Junior Developer Report</h1>
          <p>As a junior developer, I used Teams to talk to my lead. Communication went smoothly, and I didn't have any big problems.<br><br>I worked on one child page for each of the two websites I was assigned to. For Brad Holbrook's project, I was given a wireframe for the painting page but no specific images. I picked one I thought worked and checked with my lead, who said it was fine.<br><br>For Ethan Shower's project, I wasn't given a wireframe or any details for the contact page. I made a simple form and asked if it was okay, and my lead said it looked good.<br><br>I didn't run into any issues with GitHub while working on these pages.</p>
          <h1>General Experience and Reflections</h1>
          <p>The most difficult part of this project was working with wireframes that were either incomplete or hard to follow. That made it tricky to know what the client really wanted.<br><br>Still, I really enjoyed making my own wireframe and learning how to use GitHub. I feel more confident now and know I'll be able to use it again in the future.<br><br>If I could do the project over, I would spend more time learning how to add cool hover effects and make the homepage more interesting.<br><br>This project helped me feel more ready for real-world work. I understand how GitHub works better now, and I learned how important clear communication is when you're working with a team—whether you're leading it or just helping out.</p>
